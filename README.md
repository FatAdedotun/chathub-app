yooooooooooooooo... long time no see yo?

yeah, i've been getting better at ReactJs and taking some number of Ls from my search for a Junior or Intern role. like we Nigerians say though, "we meuve". by God's grace, i hope to get one soon.

soooo, to get to the business of the day. I created a CHAT APPPPPPPPPPPPP!! mY God! like a bloody whatsapp, facebook messenger chat app and you can send and download files. wow. i love it.

it's a Unichat template and I used the ReactJs Chat Engine library. 
I also used Firebase for the authentication. I enabled the Google and Facebook authentication since most people will have at least either of them.

I learned about Routing, Authentication. I also used useContext and useRef for the first time as part of the React Hooks. 

I really enjoyed this project.
